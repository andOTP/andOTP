  <string name="intro_slide1_desc">Welcome to <b>andOTP</b>, this wizard will guide you through
        the initial setup. Please pay attention and read carefully otherwise you could lose data!
        \n\nDon\'t worry, you can still change any of the options later in the <b>Settings</b>.</string>
  <string name="intro_slide2_desc">To ensure the security of your accounts <b>andOTP</b> only
        stores them in encrypted data files. Here you can choose which method of encryption will be
        used.</string>
  <string name="intro_slide2_desc_keystore">The KeyStore is a system component of Android for
        securely storing cryptographic keys. The advantage of this method is that the keys are
        stored separated from the data files and can be backed by hardware cryptography (if your
        device supports it). However, as the keys are not stored with the apps data, <b>this method
        prevents external backup solutions (like Titanium) from working</b>. If you choose this
        method you will have to rely on the internal backup functions provided by <b>andOTP</b>.
        \n\n<b>Warning</b>: The KeyStore is known to cause problems on some custom ROMs (and a few
        stock ones as well). If you don\'t mind entering a password / PIN every time you start
        <b>andOTP</b> it is highly recommended to use the password-based encryption instead.</string>
  <string name="intro_slide2_desc_password">This method will encrypt your data with a key
        generated from a password or PIN. The main advantage here is that this will work with
        external backup solutions (like Titanium) and is much less failure-prone than the KeyStore.
        However, you will have to enter your credentials every time you start <b>andOTP</b>.</string>
  <string name="intro_slide3_desc_keystore">Here you can setup an authentication to lock
        <b>andOTP</b>. Since you have chosen <b>Android KeyStore</b> as encryption method this is
        optional.</string>
  <string name="intro_slide3_desc_password">Here you can setup an authentication to lock
        <b>andOTP</b>. Since you have chosen <b>Password / PIN</b> as encryption method you need to
        set either a password or a PIN to proceed.</string>
  <string name="intro_slide3_warn_no_password">Please set a password to continue!</string>
  <string name="intro_slide3_warn_no_pin">Please set a PIN to continue!</string>
  <string name="intro_slide3_warn_confirm_password">Please confirm your password to continue!</string>
  <string name="intro_slide3_warn_confirm_pin">Please confirm your PIN to continue!</string>
  <string name="intro_slide4_title">Finished</string>
  <string name="intro_slide4_desc">Your settings have been saved, you are all set to use
        <b>andOTP</b> now!</string>
